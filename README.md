# Book Vocab - iOS App

A SwiftUI iOS application for tracking vocabulary words from books you read. **Now with full offline support!**

## Overview

Book Vocab helps users build their vocabulary by collecting and organizing words from their reading. Users can add books to their collection, save vocabulary words with definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences, then study them through flashcards and quizzes — all with full offline support.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Create an Account
- Launch the app
- Enter your email and password
- Tap "Sign Up" to create a new account (or "Sign In" if you have one)

### 2. Add Your First Book
- Tap the **+** button on the Home screen
- Search for a book by title (covers are auto-fetched from Google Books)
- Select a result or enter details manually
- Tap "Add" to save

### 3. Add Vocabulary Words

**From a Book:**
- Tap on a book to view its details
- Tap **+** in the toolbar
- Enter a word and tap 🔍 to look it up
- Definition, synonyms, antonyms, and examples are auto-filled
- Edit if needed, then tap "Save"

**From the Words Tab (New!):**
- Go to the **Words** tab
- Tap **+** in the toolbar
- Choose a book from the picker, or leave as "None (All Words)" for a global word
- Look up the word and save

> 💡 **Tip**: Global words (not assigned to any book) appear only in the Words tab and can be studied in "All Words" mode.

### 4. Study Your Words
- Go to the **Study** tab
- Choose a study source (All Words or a specific book)
- Select a mode:
  - **Flashcards**: Tap to flip, swipe right if you know it, swipe left to skip
  - **Multiple Choice**: Pick the correct definition
  - **Fill in the Blank**: Type the word from its definition

**After completing a session:**
1. View the **Summary Screen** with all words you studied
2. See which words you got right ✅ and which you missed ❌
3. **Select which words to mark as mastered** using checkboxes
4. Tap **"Save"** to persist your selections
5. An interstitial ad may appear (after a brief delay)
6. Return to the Study tab

> 💡 **Manual Mastery Control** — Words are never auto-marked as mastered. You decide which words you've truly learned after each session.

> 📺 **Ad Timing** — Interstitial ads only appear *after* you save your progress, never during active study or before your data is saved.

### 5. Track Your Progress
- View stats on the Home and Study screens
- Words marked as "mastered" are tracked
- Filter to study only words you're still learning

## 📴 Offline Functionality

**Book Vocab works fully offline!**

- **Books & Vocab**: All added books and vocabulary words are cached locally using Core Data
- **Study Sessions**: Flashcards and quizzes work without an internet connection
- **Auto-Sync**: Changes made offline are automatically synced to Supabase when you're back online
- **Offline Indicator**: A banner appears when you're offline

> 💡 **Tip**: Add books and look up words while online, then study anywhere — even without Wi-Fi!

## Requirements

- **iOS 17.0+**
- **Xcode 15.0+**
- **Swift 5.9+**

## 🔐 Required Environment Secrets

The app requires several API keys to be configured in `BookVocab/Config/Secrets.swift`. Copy the example file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp BookVocab/Config/Secrets.example.swift BookVocab/Config/Secrets.swift
```

| Secret | Required | Source | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `supabaseUrl` | ✅ Yes | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) | Your Supabase project URL |
| `supabaseKey` | ✅ Yes | Supabase Dashboard | Your Supabase anon/public key |
| `mixpanelToken` | ⚠️ Recommended | [mixpanel.com](https://mixpanel.com) | Analytics token (app works without it) |

**AdMob Configuration** (in `Info.plist`):

| Key | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `GADApplicationIdentifier` | ✅ For ads | Your AdMob App ID |

> ⚠️ **Important:** `Secrets.swift` is gitignored and must never be committed. Test ad unit IDs are used by default in `AdManager.swift`.

## 📺 AdMob Integration

Book Vocab uses Google AdMob for monetization with a premium ad-removal option.

### Ad Placements

#### MREC Banner Ads (300x250)
- **Home View (Books)**: Inserted after every 5 books
- **All Words View**: Inserted after every 5 vocabulary words
- **Book Detail View**: One at the top of the word list, then every 5 words

#### Interstitial Ads
- **After Study Sessions**: Shown after user taps "Save" on the session summary screen
- **Timing flow**:
  1. User completes flashcards or quiz → Summary screen appears
  2. User reviews results and selects words to mark as mastered
  3. User taps "Save" → Progress is persisted to database
  4. Brief delay (1.5s) → Interstitial ad appears
  5. User dismisses ad → Returns to Study tab
- **Key guarantee**: Progress is always saved *before* the ad appears
- Never interrupts active study or blocks data saving

### Premium Ad Removal

Users can remove all ads by setting `isPremium = true` (stored in `@AppStorage`):

```swift
// Check premium status anywhere in the app
@AppStorage("isPremium") var isPremium: Bool = false

// All ads are wrapped with:
if !isPremium { AdMRECView() }
```

### Ad Unit IDs

The app uses **test ad unit IDs** by default. To switch to production:

1. Open `BookVocab/Services/AdManager.swift`
2. Replace the test IDs with your production IDs:

```swift
// Current (Test IDs - for development only)
static let mrecAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111"
static let interstitialAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1033173712"

// Replace with your production IDs:
static let mrecAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYY"
static let interstitialAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/ZZZZZZZZZZ"
```

### Required Setup

1. **Add Google Mobile Ads SDK** via Swift Package Manager:
   - In Xcode: File → Add Package Dependencies
   - URL: `https://github.com/googleads/swift-package-manager-google-mobile-ads`
   - Add `GoogleMobileAds` product to your target

2. **Configure Info.plist** (required for AdMob):
   ```xml
   <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
   <string>ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY</string>
   <key>SKAdNetworkItems</key>
   <array>
       <!-- Add SKAdNetwork IDs from Google's documentation -->
   </array>
   ```

3. **App Transport Security** (if needed):
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

### Safety Rules

- Ads only show if user has 5+ items (books or words)
- No multiple ads in a row
- Interstitials never interrupt active study
- All ads respect premium status

## 📊 Mixpanel Analytics Integration

Book Vocab uses Mixpanel for comprehensive analytics tracking with offline support.

### Setup

1. Create a Mixpanel account at [mixpanel.com](https://mixpanel.com) (free tier available)
2. Create a new project for BookVocab
3. Copy your Project Token from Settings > Project Settings
4. Add to your `Secrets.swift`:

```swift
static let mixpanelToken = "your-mixpanel-token"
```

### Debug Logging

In debug builds, all analytics events are logged to the console with the `📊` prefix:

```
📊 Tracked: Study Session Started
📊 Properties: ["study_mode": "Flashcards", "word_count": 10]
```

Production builds have logging disabled.

### Adding New Events

To add a new event:

1. Add the event to `AnalyticsEvent` enum in `AnalyticsService.swift`
2. Add any new properties to `AnalyticsProperty` enum
3. (Optional) Create a convenience method for complex events
4. Call `AnalyticsService.shared.track(.yourEvent, properties: [...])`

Example:
```swift
// In AnalyticsService.swift
enum AnalyticsEvent: String {
    case newFeatureUsed = "New Feature Used"
}

// In your view/viewmodel
AnalyticsService.shared.track(.newFeatureUsed, properties: [
    "feature_name": "gamification",
    "level": 5
])
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chrisgrybo/book-vocab-ios.git
   cd book-vocab-ios
   ```

2. **Configure Supabase credentials**
   ```bash
   cp BookVocab/Config/Secrets.example.swift BookVocab/Config/Secrets.swift
   ```
   Then edit `Secrets.swift` with your Supabase URL and anon key.

3. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open BookVocab.xcodeproj
   ```

4. **Build and Run**
   - Select a simulator or device (iOS 17.0+)
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

## Configuration

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy `BookVocab/Config/Secrets.example.swift` to `BookVocab/Config/Secrets.swift`
3. Update with your credentials:
   ```swift
   enum Secrets {
       // Supabase
       static let supabaseUrl = "https://your-project.supabase.co"
